# users
A service to keep track of users and to allow them to follow others

# Problem

We have a number of users that we need to keep track of, we also wish to keep track of the 

connections between users

# Solution

We would like you to build a web app or service that allows

• Multiple users to register

• Registered users to search for other users, but not see the who the users are connected too

• Registered users to form a connection with alternative users

• An admin username to see the a list of users with connections

# Restrictions

• You may use either Python, Node.JS, Ruby Java, .Net*, but we primarily use Java and Node.JS

• You may use any library and framework of your choice. 

• Must work on Mac or Linux

# Considerations

• Your solution should come with deployment instructions

• We do like running tests

• Each person who evaluates solution will attempt to build it

• The Application & Integration team is multi-disciplined but the primary disciplines are Java and 

Node.JS

• When this is evaluated you will not be around to explain how your solution builds, deploys or how 

to set up seed data

• This may be evaluated on either a Mac or Linux machine, but not windows

• *.Net is included in one of the known languages, we only have access to Mono with limited 

exposure

# Executing

run UsersApp

connect to  http://localhost:4567/users
